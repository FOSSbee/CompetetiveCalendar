# CompetetiveCalendar

This is an application supposed to help competetive coders keep track of challenges available on different platforms and plan accordingly. The plan is to roll out a google chrome extension and an android application version, both of which will be synced. We plan to give the user the option of adding events as in he/she likes and will also later add the functionality to choose websites to recieve pings from to be added to the calendar. Along with delete and remove options. The application will also have a reminder functionality to remind the user of the forthcoming challenge.

Another functionality could be to add tracks for the user to solve sample and older problems of similar challenges along with daily reminders so that the user can practice efficiently. And depending on his/her performance we can decide what next problem to provide him/her. *Need to come up with an algorithm for this*
